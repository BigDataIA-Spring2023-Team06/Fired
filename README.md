# FIRED

FIRED (Find Ideal Roles Easily with Data) is a web application that simplifies the job search process for job seekers. With the competitive and complex job market, job seekers often struggle to find roles that fit their skills and experience, wasting time and effort applying for positions that are not a good fit.

## How FIRED Works

FIRED leverages data and AI to match job seekers with their ideal roles. The application analyzes job postings and resumes to provide job seekers with a list of recommended roles that match their skills, experience, and career goals. Job seekers can also upload their resumes and receive personalized feedback on how to optimize their resumes for specific roles.

For hiring managers, FIRED provides a tool for screening and understanding resumes better. By using the application, hiring managers can quickly and easily see how well a candidate's resume matches the job requirements. This saves time and effort and helps hiring managers to identify the most qualified candidates for the job.

Overall, FIRED is an essential tool for job seekers who want to simplify their job search process and for hiring managers who want to find the best candidates for their job openings.
